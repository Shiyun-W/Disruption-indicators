# Knowledge-entity-based disruption indicators
This project is created for providing the main source code of our latest manuscript "Quantifying scientific breakthroughs by a novel disruption indicator based on knowledge entities" that submitted to JASIST (The Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology).

# General Information
## Introduction
We proposed a novel knowledge-entity-based disruption indicator that differs from prior ones (Funk & Owen-Smith, 2017; Wu et al., 2019; Bornmann et al., 2020). This indicator quantifies the change of knowledge elements directly created and inspired by a focal paper to its evolutionary trajectory.

The effectiveness of the proposed indicators was evaluated against four standard scientific breakthrough datasets linked to a large-scale PubMed dataset (Liang et al., 2021). We evaluated the ability of our indicator in distinguishing the standard scientific breakthroughs from non-breakthrough papers in the PubMed dataset and compared the performance of our indicator with several baseline disruption indicators.

## Content
### disruption indicators
- `disruption indicators.ipynb` includes the main source codes for five disruption indicators (three baseline indicators that proposed by previous studies and two new indicators that proposed in our research)

### Figures and tables
- `figures and tables.ipynb` includes data processing and plotting code for the main figures and tables in our paper.
